            We developed and validated a deep learning (DL)-based model using the segmentation method and assessed its ability to detect lung cancer on chest radiographs. Chest radiographs for use as a training dataset and a test dataset were collected separately from January 2006 to June 2018 at our hospital. The training dataset was used to train and validate the DL-based model with five-fold cross-validation. The model sensitivity and mean false positive indications per image (mFPI) were assessed with the independent test dataset. The training dataset included 629 radiographs with 652 nodules/masses and the test dataset included 151 radiographs with 159 nodules/masses. The DL-based model had a sensitivity of 0.73 with 0.13 mFPI in the test dataset. Sensitivity was lower in lung cancers that overlapped with blind spots such as pulmonary apices, pulmonary hila, chest wall, heart, and sub-diaphragmatic space (0.50–0.64) compared with those in non-overlapped locations (0.87). The dice coefficient for the 159 malignant lesions was on average 0.52. The DL-based model was able to detect lung cancers on chest radiographs, with low mFPI.},

    abstract = {322Objectives: PET segmentation is an active field of research and tumor
    heterogeneity remains a challenging task in this setting. The emerging
    concept of deep learning together with higher hardware performance levels
    have recently promoted the use of artificial neural networks in the medical
    field. In this context, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are particularly
    adapted to pattern recognitions, including image-based classifications and
    segmentations. If several CT or MRI studies provided recent promising
    results, the use of CNN in PET imaging specifically, remains widely
    under-evaluated. In this study, we investigated the performance of a
    three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) to segment
    heterogeneous 18F-FDG PET lung tumors, compared to an optimized expert-based
    reference standard. Methods: Seventy-six 18F-FDG PET lung tumors with various
    degrees of heterogeneity were retrospectively included. For each PET tumor, a
    probabilistic estimate of the ground truth was computed from the set of six
    expert-based manual segmentation results using the Simultaneous Truth and
    Performance Level Estimate algorithm (STAPLE). The 76 PET samples (inputs)
    and their corresponding STAPLE ground truth segmentation pairs (outputs)
    constituted the full dataset of the 3D-CNN procedure. All the PET samples
    were centered and scaled. The dataset was then randomly partitioned into
    training, test and validation sets (50, 6 and 20 PET samples respectively). A
    modified version of the widely used
    {\textquotedblleft}3D-Unet{\textquotedblright} CNN was built, using the
    difference between the non-weighted binary cross entropy loss and a modified
    Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) as the loss function. Activation function
    was a scaled exponential linear unit to give self-normalizing property to the
    network. For the training phase of the 3D-CNN, the following parameters were
    used: number of epochs = 750, batch size = 1, without batch normalization,
    threshold for predictions = 0.5 to produce binary segmentations. To prevent
    overfitting, augmentation techniques including random shift, crops and
    rotations combined with elastic deformations were used. Moreover, a small
    learning rate of 0.0001 was used, with a scheduled decrease factor of 10
    after 500 and 600 epochs. The testing set was only used as feedback to
    monitor the learning process and detect possible overfitting. For the
    validation phase, 4 different metrics were used to evaluate the performance
    of the 3D-CNN segmentation procedure: the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC),
    the mean absolute SUVmean and SUVmax errors, and the mean absolute relative
    volume error. Reported 95\% confidence intervals were computed using a
    non-parametric bootstrap procedure with 3000 replications for each metric.
    Results: After 750 epochs, the training and testing loss functions were
    stable at -0.91 (DSC = 0.93), and the corresponding learning curves did not
    exhibit signs of overfitting. The fully trained 3D-CNN applied to the
    validation set provided the following performance metrics: the mean DSC was
    0.911 (95\%CI = 0.887 - 0.925); the mean absolute SUVmax error was null for
    all the 20 validation samples; the mean absolute SUVmean error was 0.26
    (95\%CI = 0.20 - 0.37); the mean absolute relative volume error was 10.9 \%
    (95\%CI = 8.1 - 14.2 \%). Conclusion: Compared to the optimized expert-based
    ground truth, our 3D-CNN provided excellent performance metrics to segment
    heterogeneous lung tumors, despite a limited training set. A fully-trained
    3D-CNN is automated and does not require complex pre-processing imaging
    workflow. Given more diversified samples to train on, performance of our
    3D-CNN would be further increased. Larger multicenter studies are warranted
    to validate such 3D-CNN approach as a potential new reference standard in
    this setting.

Various medical imaging modalities, such as chest X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and molecular imaging techniques, have been extensively studied for lung cancer detection. These techniques have some limitations, including not classifying cancer images automatically, which is unsuitable for patients with other pathologies. It is urgently necessary to develop a sensitive and accurate approach to the early diagnosis of lung cancer. Deep learning is one of the fastest-growing topics in medical imaging, with rapidly emerging applications spanning medical image-based and textural data modalities. With the help of deep learning-based medical imaging tools, clinicians can detect and classify lung nodules more accurately and quickly. This paper presents the recent development of deep learning-based imaging techniques for early lung cancer detection.},

    abstract = {Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a variation of supervised learning where a single class label is assigned to a bag of instances. In this paper, we state the MIL problem as learning the Bernoulli distribution of the bag label where the bag label probability is fully parameterized by neural networks. Furthermore, we propose a neural network-based permutation-invariant aggregation operator that corresponds to the attention mechanism. Notably, an application of the proposed attention-based operator provides insight into the contribution of each instance to the bag label. We show empirically that our approach achieves comparable performance to the best MIL methods on benchmark MIL datasets and it outperforms other methods on a MNIST-based MIL dataset and two real-life histopathology datasets without sacrificing interpretability.},
